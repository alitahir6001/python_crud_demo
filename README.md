# python_crud_demo

A travel planner to manage plans for any future trips. This is one of several create, read, update, delete (CRUD) web apps I wrote in Python using the Django framework.

Features:
  - Login and Registration page with error validation messages for incomplete fields
  - A dashboard page specific to each user, and only accessible once a user has logged in (aka can't access dashboards of other users)
  
Future App Goals:
  - More styling using bootstrap. 
  - "Shared travel" feature that shows trip locations of other users and the option to join or leave that trip.
    - Option to view all "shared trips"
  - Links to airline, and hotel websites to book trip (possible to have some fields pre-populated? Dates, location, etc).
